<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p><i>The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) is currently in progress. To honor this competition, our problems for this round have IOI-flavored stories.</i></p><br></br>
<p>
Sometimes an IOI task will use a different model of computation in order to bring the contestants out of their comfort zone.
For example, in the IOI 2012 task "Odometer" the contestants were programming a simple robot on a grid to solve some algorithmic problems.
This problem will also offer you such an experience.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
In this problem, a <i>valid program</i> is a finite sequence of positive rational numbers.
Let N and D be the sequence of their numerators and the sequence of their denominators, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The <i>memory</i> of our program consists of a single positive integer M.
</p>
<p>
When executing a program, each step looks as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the smallest i such that M * (N[i] / D[i]) is an integer.</li>
<li>If such an i does not exist, the program terminates.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the new value of M is M * (N[i] / D[i]).</li>
</ol>
<p>
(Note: operations * and / used above are operations on reals. In the implementation of an interpreter we first multiply M by N[i] and then we divide the result by D[i].)
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<p>
Consider the program {1/8, 9/4, 3/2}. For this program we have N = {1, 9, 3} and D = {8, 4, 2}.
</p>
<p>
Whenever we start this program with M = 2<sup>x</sup>, it will eventually terminate and the value of M at the end of the computation will be 3<sup>y</sup> where y = x mod 3.
</p>
<p>
E.g., if we start with M = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024, during the computation we will see the values M = 128, M = 16, M = 2, and finally M = 3. At this point the computation stops because none of 3/8, 27/4, and 9/2 is an integer.
</p>
<p>
Note that the order of fractions matters. E.g., the program {9/4, 3/2, 1/8} converts 2<sup>x</sup> into 3<sup>x</sup> instead. 
</p>
<p>
Other programs that also convert 2<sup>x</sup> into 3<sup>x mod 3</sup> include {1/8, 3/2}, {3/2, 1/27}, and {1/27, 3/2}.
</p>

<p>
Given five numbers a, b, c, d, e, their median med(a,b,c,d,e) is the value that would be in the middle if we sorted them. For example, med(1,5,2,3,4) = 3, med(1,1,2,2,3) = 2, and med(1,2,7,2,10) = 2.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to write a program that works as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is guaranteed that at the beginning of the program the value M has the form (2<sup>a</sup> * 3<sup>b</sup> * 5<sup>c</sup> * 7<sup>d</sup> * 11<sup>e</sup>) for some 0 &lt;= a,b,c,d,e &lt;= 100.</li>
<li>Let m = med(a,b,c,d,e).</li>
<li>Your program must eventually terminate, and when it does, the final value M must be equal to 47<sup>m</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your program must satisfy the following additional constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>At most 99 instructions.</li>
<li>At most 3,000 steps of execution for any valid starting value M.</li>
<li>Each numerator and denominator must be a <i>positive</i> integer that fits into a signed 32-bit integer variable.</li>
<li>The value of M must never exceed 10^2500.</li>
</ul>
<br></br>
<p>
As our backend does not support this weird model, your actual task is to write a program in an ordinary programming language that produces the program { N[0] / D[0], N[1] / D[1], ... } and returns the vector &lt;int&gt; { N[0], D[0], N[1], D[1], ... }.
</p>
<p>
Your program is given a int <b>L</b>. The output of your actual program (i.e., the returned program for the weird model) will be tested on some tests where 0 &lt;= a,b,c,d,e &lt;= <b>L</b>.
In particular, for <b>L</b> = 2 (the example case) it will be tested on exactly three tests that are listed in the example annotation.
If your program correctly solves the sample, it means that it output a valid program that solves at least those three tests correctly.

The three tests used for <b>L</b> = 2 are {a,b,c,d,e} = {0,2,0,1,2}, {1,2,2,0,2}, and {0,0,0,1,0}.
</p>
<p>
The example output is a program that solves these three inputs correctly by handling each of them as a separate special case.
(This program does not solve all test cases with <b>L</b>=2 correctly, and it fails system tests.)
